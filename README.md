# Wonjun's ICS4U Classwork
I'm taking this course to be a pilot or aviation engineer which require ability in computer. So I'm hoping that I could make programs and use computer not only for searching things but also create things. I think Instgram is very interesting. The features of instagram is actually not very fancy but it's quite impressive that I can upload my photos and share my daily life with people. And also I can send message to a particular person through instagram.
